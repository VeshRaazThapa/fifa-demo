This codebase is modified from https://github.com/levindabhi/ACGPN to run custom models based on [ACGPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05863), for example a Residual ACGPN! The human parser and segmentation models are from https://github.com/levindabhi/Self-Correction-Human-Parsing-for-ACGPN and https://github.com/levindabhi/U-2-Net.
